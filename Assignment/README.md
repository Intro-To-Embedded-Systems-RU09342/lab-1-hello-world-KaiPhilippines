# Lab 1: Hello World!
A math function was implemented to perform basic mathematical, logical, and shift operations for two values, num1 and num2. The Operator is the character that indicates which operator to perform.
The Operations are:
Addition: (num1 + num2)

Subtraction: (num1 - num2)

Multiplication: (num1 * num2)

Division: (num1 / num2)

Modulus: (num1 % num2)

Left Bitwise Shift: (num1 << num2)

Right Bitwise Shift: (num1 >> num2)

Bitwise AND: (num1 & num2)

Bitwise OR: (num1 | num2)

Bitwise XOR: (num1 ^ num2)

Bitwise NOT: (~num1)
